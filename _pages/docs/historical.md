## Patch notes:

[Update 2.8.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48838) - _Season of the Worthy patch_

- Due to backend changes with the grenade launcher archetype, Fighting Lion inherited minor adjustments
- Rate of Fire increased from 72 RPM to 90 RPM
- Direct hit damage in PvE is now 35 (Previously 27)

[Update 2.0.4](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47335) - _Forsaken Cleanup patch_
- Decreased Fighting Lion damage to be brought in line with other breach-load Grenade Launchers

> This patch was in response to the fact that Fighting Lion with autoloading rifts/barricades was [doing more DPS than Power slot Grenade Launchers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9bbiwp/fighting_lion_is_currently_extremely_powerful_in/).

[Update 1.2.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46849) - _Warmind patch_
- Deals more blast damage and less direct hit damage
- Increased ammo inventory
- Increased spawn ammo
- Kills with this weapon guarantee Energy ammo drop

[Update 1.1.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46522) - _Curse of Osiris patch_

- Increased Fighting Lion damage and changed Thin the Herd perk to now grant bonus ammo rather than pulling ammo from the player inventory
