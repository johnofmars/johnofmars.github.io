As tested in the Tribute Hall.

### Damage vs Shields

|---	        |---	        |---	       |---	|---	|

Damage fall-off after 2.8.0 appears to be between 3.5m and 4.0m.

### Damage Against Titan Barricades

In patch 2.8.0, Titan Barricades have been given increased health to 600 hp, but now take 30% extra damage from Grenade Launchers.

This means that Lion rounds now do 184 splash and 34 direct hit damage, so it will take three (3) Lion rounds to break a shield.

Crucially, the damage numbers against the shield are precision yellow. This means that when you fire a shot around a shield, you can now distinguish between the damage the Titan is taking and the shield is taking.
