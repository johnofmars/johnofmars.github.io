## Archetype & perks

Lightweight Frame
> Like all _lightweight_ frames in Destiny 2, it offers an intrinsic Mobility bonus, +10 on the Shadowkeep scale.

~~72~~ 90 RPM
> Misleading, RPM is gated by reload speed, not firing rate.

## Masterwork

+27 Reload speed from **55** to **82**.

New perk:
> **Chimera** - After this weapon fires, equipped Kinetic and Power weapons gain a brief period of increased handling and accuracy.
{: .notice--success}

**Chimera** lasts for 2 seconds after firing the Lion and gives the same bonuses as **Quick Draw** and **Opening Shot**.

## Firing

Timer

Too close to arm

## Reloading

[Auto-Reloader Script](https://www.reddit.com/r/FightingLion/comments/fgl9sm/autolion_v25_weapon_toggle/)

> **Disclosure** Scripts are not legal in Destiny, especially in Pvp. As such, using them, you risk anti-cheat measures from Bungie. That said, this script is relatively benign and doesn't break anything or do anything a human can't do. **Use with caution.**
{: .notice--warning}

## Ammo Management

Exotic Perk: Thin the Herd

**Crucible**

- Spawning Ammo:  
- Maximum Ammo: 21 without perks
- Maximum Ammo: 24 with double reserves

- Ammo per random drop brick: 8,10,15
- Ammo per kill brick: _FULL_ (i.e. 20 to 24)

## Grenade Health

It is possible to have your grenade shot out of the air.

> The Fighting Lion grenade has <=11 hp in Crucible

## Tricks

-**Deflecting other Projectiles**

The Lion's grenade is treated as a projectile so that means that besides getting shot out of the air, it can deflect other projectiles, such as grenades, and yes, Sentinel Shields.

## Glitches

> **Disclosure** These are very rare, and/or hard to exploit, so don't freak out.
{: .notice--warning}

**Double Impact**

**~~Double~~ Increased Damage after death**

If you fire your round and are killed before you detonate it, it will detonate on impact with a guardian or the timer. Instead of the normal **142+26** damage, it will instead be **180 + 33**. It happens rarely and mostly when I engage with long-range, insta-kill targets such as snipers or Golden Guns.

_This used to be literally double damage, but since patch 2.8.0, it's merely +27% damage._
