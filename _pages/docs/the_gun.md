## Archetype & perks

Lightweight Frame
> Like all _lightweight_ frames in Destiny 2, it offers an intrinsic Mobility bonus, +10 on the Shadowkeep scale.

~~72~~ 90 RPM
> Misleading, RPM is gated by reload speed, not firing rate.

## Masterwork

+27 Reload speed from **55** to **82**.

New perk:
> **Chimera** - After this weapon fires, equipped Kinetic and Power weapons gain a brief period of increased handling and accuracy.
{: .notice--success}

**Chimera** lasts for 2 seconds after firing the Lion and gives the same bonuses as **Quick Draw** and **Opening Shot**.

## Firing

## Reloading

[Auto-Reloader Script](https://www.reddit.com/r/FightingLion/comments/fgl9sm/autolion_v25_weapon_toggle/)

> **Disclosure** Scripts are not legal in Destiny, especially in Pvp. As such, using them, you risk anti-cheat measures from Bungie. That said, this script is relatively benign and doesn't break anything or do anything a human can't do. **Use with caution.**
{: .notice--warning}

## Ammo Management

Exotic Perk: Thin the Herd

**Crucible**

- Spawning Ammo:  
- Ammo per random drop brick: 8,10,15
