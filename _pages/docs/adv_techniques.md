## Playing with Lion: Be Mobile

### Be Aggressive!

It is very easy to hang back and play passive, but that is not how you win. Lion has perfect hip-fire accuracy, and even imperfect detonations do massive damage. So keep moving, move unpredictably and use your enemy's weapon range against them.

### Vertical Play!

Lion has no in-air accuracy penalties. Pair it with other weapons with low/no in-air accuracy penalties, such as sidearms, SMGs, 180rpm hand cannons, etc.

### Use Cover!

A sniper poking out of cover has to aim. A hand cannon user has to be out of cover has to aim for three (3) shots minimum. A lion user? Just poke and hop twice (2) and you can get your kill. Just remember, you'll be doing it blind, so learn your velocity and geometry to get the kill.

### Learn the arc, the speed and the maps

## Tricks

### Deflecting other Projectiles

The Lion's grenade is treated as a projectile so that means that besides getting shot out of the air, it can deflect other projectiles, such as grenades, and yes, Sentinel Shields.

Yeah, but other people can deflect your grenades too!
