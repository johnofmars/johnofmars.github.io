## Warlock subclasses

Top tree Dawnblade is perfect. High on mobility and the `Celestial Fire` melee, which has three homing bolts that do 33 damage each. Wonderful long range clean-up.

### Voidwalker: 

**Attunement of Fission (Middle Tree)**
`Handheld Supernova (HHSN)` with **Contraverse Holds** used to be a monster and it filled the weak close quarters game of Lion admirably. 

**Attunement of Chaos (Top Tree)**
An alternative to middle tree, that still uses **Contraverse Holds**. Super-charging your Axion Grenade as a combo with Lion is very doable. Contraverse with Axion offers a shorter charge time and a longer hold time than HHSN. That said, it doesn’t offer that insta-kill short range solution.

### Stormcaller: 

**Attunement of Control (MIddle Tree)**
A beautiful shutdown super and another long range melee. Middle tree also offers `Pulsewave` that gives a bonus to speed for quickly disengaging. 

**Atunement of the Elements (Bottom Tree)**
It doesn’t have blink in Super, but you get an Arc Buddy on rifts for you and your allies. Your rifts charge faster, another incentive to play with your team and use your Lion for team shots. Also, your melee isn’t ranged, but does have extended range thanks to `Rising Storm`. Great choice for **Getaway Artist**.
