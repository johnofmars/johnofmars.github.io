(Under Construction)


### Considerations

Exotic choices will favor one of three things:
- **Reloading & Weapon Swaps** (like Transversive Steps or Dragon's Shadow)
- **Synergies with damage** (like Nezarac's Sin using Lion's void damage)
- **Synergies with melees** (Like Titan overshields)
- **Mobility, but especially vertical play** (like St0mp-335)
