(Under Construction)


### Considerations

Exotic choices will favor one of three things:
- **Reloading &/or Dexterity (for Weapon Swaps)** (like Transversive Steps or Dragon's Shadow)
- **Synergies with melees or grenades** (Like Titan overshields)
- **Mobility, but especially vertical play** (like St0mp-335)
- **Utility, like damage buffs or other exotic perks** (like Nezarac's Sin using Lion's void damage)

### Warlock Exotics

**Ophidian Aspects**
[Melee](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--info} [Reloading/Dexterity](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--danger}

If you prefer a strong neutral game, then Ophidians are for you. Giving +30 reload and strong handling bonuses, they’re a natural fit for Lion’s **blint** play style. That inherent reload speed buff is approximately 50% of the Fighting Lion’s reload cap. And you can stack mods to increase it.

**Transversive Steps**
[Reloading](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--danger} [Mobility](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--success}

Sprint faster, after sprinting for 2 seconds, your currently equipped weapon is reloaded. Lion has a minimum 2.5 second reload, so this is already a savings.

**Claws of the Ahamkara**
[Melee](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--info}

A second melee charge. Nothing fancy. Can help with Top Tree Dawnblade’s `Celestial Fire` melee (33 damage x 3) or middle tree Stromcaller’s `Ball Lightning` (70 splash + 31 direct hit damage). 

**Nezarac's Sins**
[Utility](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--warning}

The pinnacle of Lion exotics for PvE, this exotic synergizes with Lion’s void nature. Void kills increase ability regeneration. [For Grenades, a void kill,]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/9hd3re/best_void_energy_weapons_for_nezarec_sins_voidlock/) such as from the Lion, reduces 7 seconds from your cool down. For comparison, **Eye of another World is a flat 30 second cooldown reduction.

**Getaway Artist**
[Utility](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--warning}

Consuming your grenade creates a turret that fires out five (5) burst that do 11 damage each. It lasts for 20 seconds and makes it excellent for helping with clean-up.

**The Stag**
[Utility](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--warning}

Empowering Rifts give a 20% damage buff, and as of patch 2.8.0 it buffs direct hit damage as well. That means a direct hit will do 170+32, or 202, enough to kill all resiliences. If you want to play a more Rift centric style, then use The Stag.

**Lunafaction Boots**
[Reloading](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--danger}

Another victim of nerfs. Lunafaction rifts used to allow Lion users to become Siege Tanks and shell the blam! out of enemy targets. Sadly, they now only give an increase to reload speed.

**Verity's Brow**
[Utility](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--warning}

Recently reworked in 2.8.0. Energy weapon kills give up to 3x stacks. Each stack gives 10% damage to grenades. Throw a grenade to refresh your teammate’s grenade recharge rate. There’s still testing to be done, but the timing and damage boosts seem insufficient to work in Crucible.

**Wings of Sacred Dawn**
[Mobility](#warlock-exotics){: .btn .btn--success}

Aiming down sights holds you in place in mind-air and gives you incoming 15% damage reduction. But, you are incredibly exposed while this happens, so it has a very high risk component. Use sparingly and with a hip-fire weapon as possible. Use `Strafe` glide to expand your maneuverability when not holding in air. All that said, you can do some very cool plays such as holding above door frames and choke points. Don’t activate in the middle of the open of Bannerfall’s courtyard.

**Others**

Before the 2.8.0 patch, **Sanguine Alchemy** used to mark all targets in 30 meters if you stood in a rift. This allowed for some very fun Duck Hunt shenanigans. It's new perk of allowing indefinite rift duration with continual damage is sadly, no longer a top-tier choice for Lion users.

### Titan Exotics
