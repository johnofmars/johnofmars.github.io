[Here is a breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/hixbrKA.jpg) of which mods are available in which slot and which elemental affinity.

## Mods to take:

### Reload mods

The Lion has two phases before another round can be fired: `Reload Delay` + `Reload Animation`. Reload Delay can be mitigated by  `Manual Reloads`, i.e. reloading as soon as you fire, not after the round explodes. We will test both the reload animation alone as well as the shot to shot time, which would include both Reload Delay and Reload Animation.


**Reload Animation**
This test only judges the time from the start of reload animation to return to neutral position.

| Perks       	| Time  	| Reduction |
|:-----------  	|-------:	|---------:	|
| None        	| 3:04   	| _(base)_  |
| Ophidians, no mods   	| 2:49  	| -8%      	|
| 1x Large Arms  | 2:37  	| -15%     	|
| 1x GL Loader  | 2:32  	| -17%     	|
| 1x Enhanced   | 2:29  	| -19%     	|
| 2x Large Arm  | 2:27  	| -20%     	|
| 2x GL loader  | 2:27  	| -20%     	|
| 2x Enhanced   | 2:26  	| -21%     	|

**Fire to Fire**

Refer to the [Reloading section of The Gun for detail on Manual Reloading.](/the_gun/#reloading)

| Perks       	| Time  	| Reduction |
|:-----------  	|-------:	|---------:	|
| Hand-off reload | 3:25  	| _(base)_  |
| Manual reload   | 2:04  	| -40%  	|
| 2x Enhanced   | 1:46  	| -48%  	|

> Note: These times are shorter than the above, because it's using reload cuts, i.e. smashing the firing button to fire as soon as possible, rather than waiting for the full animation reload.

### Ammo Mods (Scavenger & Reserve)

Two things determine how ammo will work for your lion:
- If your kinetic weapon is primary or special ammo.
    - Ammo drops are split between weapon slots that share the same ammo type. So running a kinetic primary weapon will halve your ammo for your Lion.
- If the ammo brick is a random spawn or generated by your Fighting Lion Kill.
    - Lion kill ammo bricks will completely refill your entire inventory, no matter the size. Random bricks will refill 30%, 15% if you're using double primaries.


| Mod           	| Ammo Brick | Kill Brick |
|:---------------	|	-------:	|------------:	|
| None          	| 3 / 6 | 10 / 20 |
| 1x GL Reserves  	| 3 / 7 | 11 / 22 |
| 2x GL  Reserves  	| 3 / 8 |  12 / 24 |


| Mod           	| Spawn 	| Max 	|
|:---------------	|-------:	|-----:	|
| None          	| 10*    	| 20    	|
| One Reserves  	| 10*    	|  22   	|
| Two Reserves  	| 10*    	|  24   	|

 (* somewhat random, I've spawned with 10,11 or 12)

|  Mod         	| none 	| 1x Reserves 	| 2x Reserves 	|
|:--------------	|------:	|-------------:	|-------------:	|
| none         	| 7    	| 7           	| 7           	|
| 1x Scavenger 	| 7    	| 8           	| 9           	|
| 2x Scavenger 	| 7    	| 9           	| 9           	|

**Notes:**
- Heavy Ammo bricks and Heavy Ammo Crucible Spawns do _not_ give Lion ammo.
- If you are empty in Crucible, you have to wait for an enemy to give you a primary brick. There is no automatic granting of ammo like in PvE.

### Dire Artillery

(Source: Obelisks in Season of the Dawn, Vendor rank ups afterward.)
>Grants additional Super energy on Energy or Power Grenade Launcher final blows.

This perk is correctly worded. It's by slot (Kinetic/Energy), not by ammo type (Primary/Special). [Confirmed to work with Fighting Lion, but _not_ Mountaintop.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnderstatedMarvelousIrukandjijellyfish-mobile.mp4)

Also, it stacks.

> Tested with a Tier 1 combatant in the Tribute Hall. The enemy kill was at 50%.

Eyeballing, but 2.5% with 1 mod, 5% with 2x mods.

It works in Crucible too:

### Other choices:

- **Unflinching mods for your Kinetic Weapon (but not GL unflinching)**
  - You only need to be on your target for an instant with Fighting Lion out. But then you'll need to swap to your kinetic to clean it up. This means you'll be swapping and potentially ADSing in the middle of your fight. Unflinching mods for your kinetic are invaluable since you won't have the advantage of opening the fight with your kinetic.
- **Traction**
  - Fighting Lion is a mobility based weapon, so having the +10 mobility and increased turn speed is a real asset.

## Mods to avoid:

- Ammo Finder
  - Fighting Lion's exotic perk provides Primary ammo on kill, so this is unnecessary.
  - In PvE, it's a good choice because it procs A LOT, because the game thinks you're using a special ammo weapon, which has less up time.
- Excessive GL launcher reload perks
  - You get 80% of the reload cap with a single GL loader. [See the **Reloading** for more detail.](/docs/armor/#reload-mods)
- Concussive Dampener does NOT work in Crucible
- Dexterity mods
  - Fighting Lion already has a *100* in Handling, so it doesn't need the help. As far as kinetics, remember Fighting Lion's Masterwork perk, Chimera. This masterwork effectively gives your kinetic Quickdraw.  Dexterity mods still help, since it's not true "Quickdraw", but it has diminishing returns.

## Sample Builds

**Head (any element):**
- Enhanced Aiming Perks or 2x Regular Aiming Perks
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Void Gloves:**
- 1x Grenade Launcher loader (3 energy)
- 1x HC Loader (3 energy) OR
- 1x Sniper Loader (4 energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Ophidian Aspects (Solar/Arc):**
> Because Ophidians gives a +30 to handling and huge reload boosts, you get more bang for your buck with other perks for your grenades/melees.

- Fastball (2 energy)
- Enhanced Momentum Transfer (3 Solar energy) OR
- Enhanced Impact Induction (5 Arc energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Chest (any element):**
- Unfliching of your kinetic's choice

**Boots with _Primary_ Ammo Kinetic Weapon (any element):**
> With Chimera giving Quickdraw like boosts to handling, you don't need Dexterity perks, really. Additionally, GL scavenger doesn't work on Lion, since it takes Primary ammo. But honestly, there aren't a lot of options left, so take a dexterity perk anyway.

- Traction (3 energy)
- Primary Weapon Dexterity (1-2 energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Boots with _Special_ Ammo Kinetic Weapon (any element):**
> With Chimera giving Quickdraw like boosts to handling, you don't need Dexterity perks, really. Additionally, GL scavenger doesn't work on Lion, since it takes Primary ammo. So take a dexterity perk anyway.

- Traction (3 energy)
- Special Ammo Weapon Dexterity (2-4 energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Void Class Item**
> The only element and perk that has direct Lion synergy is Dire Artillery. If you don't want to use Lion as your primary means of getting kills, then build however you would otherwise.

- Dire Artillery x2 (3 energy x2)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

## Charged with Light Build
Courtesy of **u/Illyxi**

- 1x High Energy Fire, 1x Protective Light, and either 2x Blast Radius (double solar) or 1x Blast Radius, 1x Stacks on Stacks (one solar, one void for GL affinity)
- In total requires 4 pieces of armor, leaving your Exotic open, and only requires one or two solar so you can spec GLs
- I typically go GL loader gauntlets with High Energy Fire, double Dire Artillery class item with Protective Light, and solar chest and boots for Blast Radius, leaving my helmet on Warlock for Nezarec's Sin, which cannot take a Seasonal mod.

## Stats

**Top 3:**
1. Mobility
  - You need to be able to peak shoot and disengage quickly. Mobility is king.
  - Mobility also helps hunters with (reload) Dodge cooldown, so it's win-win.
2. Recovery
  - Do not neglect Recovery. Helpful for peak shooting and disengaging both.
  - Also, on Warlock, reduces your **Rift** cooldown.
3. Strength or Discipline, depending on your subclass & playstyle
  - I'm a neutral game player. I like Melees or Grenades to help with kills outside of Supers. Additionally, Melee & Strength mods are only **3 energy** while Intelligence (Super) mods are **5 energy** and restrict your armor mods choices unnecessarily.
