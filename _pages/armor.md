[Here is a breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/hixbrKA.jpg) of which mods are available in which slot and which elemental affinity.

## Mods to take:

### Reload mods

The Lion has two phases before another round can be fired: `Reload Delay` + `Reload Animation`. Reload Delay can be mitigated by  `Manual Reloads`, i.e. reloading as soon as you fire, not after the round explodes. We will test both the reload animation alone as well as the shot to shot time, which would include both Reload Delay and Reload Animation.


**Reload Animation**
This test only judges the time from the start of reload animation to return to neutral position.

| Perks       	| Time  	| Reduction |
|:-----------  	|-------:	|---------:	|
| None        	| 3:04   	| _(base)_  |
| Ophidians, no mods   	| 2:49  	| -8%      	|
| 1x Large Arms  | 2:37  	| -15%     	|
| 1x GL Loader  | 2:32  	| -17%     	|
| 1x Enhanced   | 2:29  	| -19%     	|
| 2x Large Arm  | 2:27  	| -20%     	|
| 2x GL loader  | 2:27  	| -20%     	|
| 2x Enhanced   | 2:26  	| -21%     	|

**Fire to Fire**

Refer to the [Reloading section of The Gun for detail on Manual Reloading.](/the_gun/#reloading)

| Perks       	| Time  	| Reduction |
|:-----------  	|-------:	|---------:	|
| Hand-off reload | 3:25  	| _(base)_  |
| Manual reload   | 2:04  	| -40%  	|
| 2x Enhanced   | 1:46  	| -48%  	|

> Note: These times are shorter than the above, because it's using reload cuts, i.e. smashing the firing button to fire as soon as possible, rather than waiting for the full animation reload.

### Ammo Mods (Scavenger & Reserve)

Two things determine how ammo will work for your lion:
- If your kinetic weapon is primary or special ammo.
    - Ammo drops are split between weapon slots that share the same ammo type. So running a kinetic primary weapon will halve your ammo for your Lion.
- If the ammo brick is a random spawn or generated by your Fighting Lion Kill.
    - Lion kill ammo bricks will completely refill your entire inventory, no matter the size. Random bricks will refill 30%, 15% if you're using double primaries.


| Mod           	| Ammo Brick | Kill Brick |
|:---------------	|	-------:	|------------:	|
| None          	| 4 / 8 | 13 / 26 |
| 1x GL Reserves  	| 4 / 9 | 14 / 28 |
| 2x GL  Reserves  	| 4 / 9 |  15 / 30 |


| Mod           	| Spawn 	| Max 	|
|:---------------	|-------:	|-----:	|
| None          	| 10*    	| 26    	|
| 1x GL Reserves  	| 10*    	|  28   	|
| 2x GL Reserves  	| 10*    	|  30   	|

 (* somewhat random, I've spawned with 10,11 or 12)

How Scavenger Mods interact with Reserve Mods:

|  Mod         	| none 	| 1x Reserves 	| 2x Reserves 	|
|:--------------	|------:	|-------------:	|-------------:	|
| none         	| 8    	| 8           	| 8           	|
| 1x Scavenger 	| 8    	| 9           	| 9           	|
| 2x Scavenger 	| 8    	| 9           	| 9           	|

**Notes:**
- Heavy Ammo bricks and Heavy Ammo Crucible Spawns do _not_ give Lion ammo.
- If you are empty in Crucible, you have to wait for an enemy to give you a primary brick. There is no automatic granting of ammo like in PvE.

### Dire Artillery
![Dire Artillery](/assets/images/dire_artillery.png)

(Source: Obelisks in Season of the Dawn, Vendor rank ups afterward.)
>Grants additional Super energy on Energy or Power Grenade Launcher final blows.

This perk is correctly worded. It's by slot (Kinetic/Energy), not by ammo type (Primary/Special). [Confirmed to work with Fighting Lion, but _not_ Mountaintop.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnderstatedMarvelousIrukandjijellyfish-mobile.mp4)

Also, it stacks.

![stacks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/647452715441717248/654820665467338752/unknown.png)
> Tested with a Tier 1 combatant in the Tribute Hall. The enemy kill was at 50%.

Eyeballing it here, but 2.5% with 1 mod, 5% with 2x mods.

It works in Crucible too:

### Other choices:

- **Unflinching mods for your Kinetic Weapon (but not GL unflinching)**
  - You only need to be on your target for an instant with Fighting Lion out. But then you'll need to swap to your kinetic to clean it up. This means you'll be swapping and potentially ADSing in the middle of your fight. Unflinching mods for your kinetic are invaluable since you won't have the advantage of opening the fight with your kinetic.
- **Traction**
  - Fighting Lion is a mobility based weapon, so having the +10 mobility and increased turn speed is a real asset.

## Mods to avoid in PvP:

- Ammo Finder
  - Fighting Lion's exotic perk provides Primary ammo on kill, so this is unnecessary.
  - In PvE, it's a good choice because it procs A LOT, because the game thinks you're using a special ammo weapon, which has less up time.
- Excessive GL launcher reload perks
  - You get 80% of the reload cap with a single GL loader. [See the **Reloading** for more detail.](/armor/#reload-mods)
- Concussive Dampener does NOT work in Crucible
- Dexterity mods
  - Fighting Lion already has a *100* in Handling, so it doesn't need the help. As far as kinetics, remember Fighting Lion's Masterwork perk, Chimera. This masterwork effectively gives your kinetic Quickdraw.  Dexterity mods still help, since it's not true "Quickdraw", but it has diminishing returns.
  - For more on Dexterity Perks, Freehand Mod and Quickdraw, refer to [this post on r/CruciblePlayBook](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/a0itxx/massive_breakdown_of_dexterity_perks_with/)

## Sample Builds

**Head (any element):**
- Enhanced Aiming Perks or 2x Regular Aiming Perks
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Void Gloves:**
- 1x Grenade Launcher loader (3 energy)
- 1x HC Loader (3 energy) OR
- 1x Sniper Loader (4 energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Ophidian Aspects (Solar/Arc):**
> Because Ophidians gives a +30 to handling and huge reload boosts, you get more bang for your buck with other perks for your grenades/melees.

- Fastball (2 energy)
- Enhanced Momentum Transfer (3 Solar energy) OR
- Enhanced Impact Induction (5 Arc energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Chest (any element):**
- Unfliching of your kinetic's choice

**Boots with _Primary_ Ammo Kinetic Weapon (any element):**
> With Chimera giving Quickdraw like boosts to handling, you don't need Dexterity perks, really. Additionally, GL scavenger doesn't work on Lion, since it takes Primary ammo. But honestly, there aren't a lot of options left, so take a dexterity perk anyway.

- Traction (3 energy)
- Primary Weapon Dexterity (1-2 energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Boots with _Special_ Ammo Kinetic Weapon (any element):**
> With Chimera giving Quickdraw like boosts to handling, you don't need Dexterity perks, really. Additionally, GL scavenger doesn't work on Lion, since it takes Primary ammo. So take a dexterity perk anyway.

- Traction (3 energy)
- Special Ammo Weapon Dexterity (2-4 energy)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

**Void Class Item**
> The only element and perk that has direct Lion synergy is Dire Artillery. If you don't want to use Lion as your primary means of getting kills, then build however you would otherwise.

- Dire Artillery x2 (3 energy x2)
- Stat Perk such as Mobility, Recovery, etc. (3-4 energy)

## Charged with Light Build (CwL)

Charged with Light is a really strong system that synergizes well with Lion. Unfortunately, it's a bit obtuse.

Every CwL build has needs a builder to get charges, a spender to get the benefit and _can_ have modifiers that give extra stacks or share charges with allies.
- Builder (Green icon)
- Spender (Yellow icon)
- Modifier (White icon)

**Standard Build**
The Standard build is all about getting the 20% damage boost from **High Energy Fire** and keeping it up at all times.

{% include feature_row %}

A solid 4th choice is **Protective Light** (2 void)
> When the player character is Charged with Light, they gain significant damage resistance when their shields are destroyed, consuming all stacks of Charged with Light. The more stacks consumed, the longer the damage resistance lasts.

**Empowering Build:**
Empowering builds instead of keeping 1-2 stacks, instead works to build a higher cap of Charges to empower a specific spender.

* Charger: Blast Radius  (3 Solar)
* Raise charge cap: Supercharged (5 Solar)
* Bonus Damage Spenders:
    - Swords (Lucent Blade - 4 Arc)
    - Sidearms (Surprise Attack - 5 Solar)
    - Super (Energy Converter - 4 Void)

So in summary, you always have Blast Radius & Protective Light. For Lion focused neutral game: Stacks on Stacks with High Energy Fire. For any other build, it's raising the charge cap with Supercharged and then specific mod you want (sword, sidearm, super).

## Stats

**Top 3:**
1. Mobility
  - You will always be hipfiring, so mobility is a huge asset.
  - You need to be able to peak shoot and disengage quickly. Mobility is king.
  - Mobility also helps hunters with (reload) Dodge cooldown, so it's win-win.
2. Recovery
  - Do not neglect Recovery. Helpful for peak shooting and disengaging both.
  - Also, on Warlock, reduces your **Rift** cooldown.
3. Strength or Discipline, depending on your subclass & playstyle
  - I'm a neutral game player. I like Melees or Grenades to help with kills outside of Supers. Additionally, Melee & Strength mods are only **3 energy** while Intelligence (Super) mods are **5 energy** and restrict your armor mods choices unnecessarily.
