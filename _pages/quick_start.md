## The Intro

How often do you chuckle with delight while playing Destiny 2? It's a game after all? Are you sick of Vigilance Wing and Graviton Lance? Are you ready to find a lethal toy? Are you ready to become a real Guardian?

[Then Don't Be Afraid to Dream Bigger, Darling & pick up Fighting Lion!](https://i.imgur.com/pGtgsXX.gifv)

## Part 1: The Gun

The gun is primarily designed to blint enemies. Just like snipers in D1

**blint (verb):** to body shot and quickly swap to a primary to secure the kill.

### Firing The Lion

* **Tap to Fire.** ***NEVER, EVER DO THIS.***
* **Hold & Release to Explode**
   * There is no proximity detonation. It has to be a direct hit to get maximum damage.
   * Unless you get a direct hit, you will need to manually detonate the grenade.
   * This can be used to Laying Trap around doorways, and to Explode Rounds in Doorways to block pushes.
   * Note: The Fighting Lion grenade [needs 15 meters (or about a 0.5 seconds)](https://i.imgur.com/R2S0XfD.jpg) to prime itself before it can be detonated (unless it's a body hit). This means you can't do an in-air detonation in close proximity to yourself. This is very important to note that *if you miss your direct body hit in CQC, you cannot manually detonate to get the splash damage.*
* **Damage**
   * 144 Splash and 22 for direct hit. This was buffed from 100 Splash + 48 direct hit damage in the go fast update. [This was in turn buffed](https://i.imgur.com/lhb0h9s.gifv) from before where it was 69 splash and 66 direct (for a total of 135).
   * Splash damage is a large area and will tag multiple enemies. This makes it strong for objective modes and against teams who bunch up.
   * Point blank shots (typically against enemies) will damage you just as much as them, and likely get you killed.
* **ADS vs Hip Fire**
   * Makes no difference in my testing. You'll learn the arc and won't need the cross-hairs anyway.
* **Practice, practice, practice.**

* **General advice:**
   * Be mobile! Strafe & Jump! You don't need to track your targets after the round if off, so there's less penalty for movement.
   * Peek fire! Blind Fire! After you have enough time with the gun, you'll learn when to release to explode without even seeing your target. The damage number popping up will tell you if you were successful, where the enemy is and (because it's splash damage) will tell you how many enemies are there.
   * Bounce around corners. [Even over/around shields.](https://media.giphy.com/media/1VV2DQDQ0G0xApuQDw/giphy.gifv) No one can hide from Fighting Lion, lol.
* **Exotic Perk:**

**Thin the Herd** Direct hits do more damage to enemy combatant shields. Rapid kills against grenade-damaged enemies refill the magazine. Kills always drop Energy ammo.

* **The Combo**
   * Direct hit, swap to kinetic to finish, FL is reloaded and you're good to go. This is the trademark Fighting Lion move.

## Part 2: Getting Kills

Fighting Lion does the same damage regardless of distance, but your preferred engagement distance will dictate your playstyle. A Fighting Lion loadout is primarily defined by the engagement distance of your Kinetic. That said, regardless of your loadout, it's important to know how to use the Lion at every distance.

**Melee Range**
Treat it like a shotgun, follow up with melee. Charged or uncharged melees will finish the fight. Subclass trees that have healing melees are a natural fit for this, as are melee exotics. Just don't fire the Lion point blank or you'll injure yourself.

**Close Range**
Aggressive sidearm/SMG play is a natural fit for FL. Utilizing sliding or vertical space, it's very easy to clean up kills.

**Medium Range**
Hand cannons are crispy and have good range and versatility. They're the signature pairing with FL. Hand cannons also allow for more cautious use and I prefer them in Comp/Trials where deaths are more costly. For most hand cannons, a single headshot will put down an enemy directly hit by a Lion (details below).

**Long Range**
Pair with a sniper, Teamshot, zoning, deterring pushes Double-tapping
