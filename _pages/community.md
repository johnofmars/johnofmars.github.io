To my friends, I'm a hardcore Lion user. To this community, I'm a casual, lol.


## The Feud

The Fighting Lion maintains a friendly war with Jotunn users.

Let's see:

|            	| Fighting Lion     	| Jotunn    	|
|------------	|-------------------	|-----------	|
| Ammo       	| Primary           	| Special   	|
| Aiming     	| PhD in Geometry   	| Nah       	|
| Detonation 	| Intuition & Heart 	| Proximity 	|
| Damage     	| Blint             	| One-shot  	|

**Winner**: _Fighting Lion!_

**Loser**: No skill Jotunn!
