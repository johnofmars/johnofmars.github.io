To help you pick a weapon for pairing with your Lion, we're going to do look at 3 things:
- Preferred Engagement Distance and Playstyle
- Archetypes
- Perks

And then end with some of my favorites.

## Distance & playstyle

The Getting Started page was all about Lion's strengths for distance and playstyle. But if you want to become a master, it's important to understand Lion's weaknesses, as well as its strengths.

- Lion is weakest in **close** quarters. [It cannot be remoted detonated within 15 meters or 0.5 seconds of firing](https://i.imgur.com/R2S0XfD.jpg). But don't worry, direct hits will explode. But with a requirement to get direct hits and a 2.5 second (minimum) reload time, you _must_ have something in your back pocket to deal with apes. Sidearms and SMGs are great options, and so are shotguns, but you can also rely on your subclass abilities of grenades and melees to supplement. Even if you want to play long range, you must be prepared for apes.
- Lion is second weakest at **long** ranges. A 2.5 second reload time is often enough time for enemies to disengage and begin recovery. A long-range weapon such as a sniper or even pulse rifle can supplement here.

Fighting Lion is incredibly versatile and can be used with just about any playstyle. So consider your own preferences as well as those weaknesses and start building your loadout.
- Lion is most comfortable at **close-mid range** _where you are the aggressor_. Put in shots until you tag the enemy and push with your kinetic.
- Lion is a **team play gun**. A Lion round that hits while a teammate hits with a single hand cannon head shot is _INSTANT_ death.

Lastly, triple grenade launcher isn't just a meme.

It's real and big and is my friend.

One last thing to note. Fighting Lion is very viable as part of a Double Primaries Loadout. Double primary has the advantage of starving your enemies of Special ammo. That means it _costs_ them ammo to kill you.

## Archetypes

A perfect Lion shot in PvP will result in 166 damage. But it's also possible to get as low as say 40 damage. There are two schools of thought to how to clean up the Lion:

- Big damage follow-up
  - Think something like a sniper/grenade launcher. These are very effective clean-up options, but they do take special ammo. Primaries can also work, but for big damage clean-up you'll be limited to just a few archetypes. A good example is a 110 RPM hand cannon's damage will do the job.

- Small damage follow-up
  - Picture **Recluse**:  its fast 900 RPM firerate means that regardless of target health, you're spraying them down and can get a good fast TTK. The difference is that instead of instant TTK from a 110rpm Headshot, you _have_ to have more shots. There aren't any big break point penalties either, so your TTK is more consistent and even faster than slower RPMs.

Using [Mercules' Massive Breakdown Weapons Stats Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_6zsM7kzvg0aUT8YtM_-Wg_5K1gKDOlrwfVzutEjq-s/edit#gid=0), I modified it to determine **Shots to Kill** (STK) and **Time to Kill (TTK)** for various RPM handcannons. The below charts will show the effect between Big & Small Damage follow-ups:

As you can see:
- You're _less_ likely to need a follow-up shot with a 110rpm, _but_ if you need that second shot, it'll take forever.
- You're _more_ likely to need a follow-up shot with a 180rpm, _but_ it'll be ready sooner.
- Included, for reference, is a Lightweight RPM SMG(like Recluse), shooting at 80% accuracy, so you can see the effect of the fastest RPM gun and how strong a fast flexible choice is as well.

Of course, there are other options to consider such as handling, engagement distance, whether you want to prioritize accuracy or number of shots, etc. But with this information, you can make an informed choice.


## Perks

### A reminder of Lion's Chimera Perk
The Masterwork is *essential* to using the Lion in Crucible!

New perk:
> **Chimera** - After this weapon fires, equipped Kinetic and Power weapons gain a brief period of increased handling and accuracy.
{: .notice--success}

`Chimera` lasts for 3 seconds after firing the Lion and gives the same bonuses as `Quick Draw`, `Snapshot Sights` and `Opening Shot`

Look at difference with a low handling **Redrix's Broadsword**:

Let me say that again. Fighting Lion's Masterwork perk gives your Kinetic weapon the following perks:

### Other perks

- **Mobility Improving**

  - `Lightweight Frames`, gives +20 mobility.
  - `Moving Target`, `Hipfire Grip` If you prefer to ADS or hipfire, these will help with your strafe speed greatly.
  - `Air Assault` lmao, I dunno, I kinda want to try it with an **Austringer**.

- **Damage Perks**
  - `Kill clip`, `Rampage`

  - `Vorpal` - Do extra damage to Guardians using their Super.
    - **Breachlight**, a sidearm, does 50% extra dmg against supers.  It's a 3 shot head and 4 shot body on supers. It 2 shots golden gun super.

    - **Trophy Hunter**, a sniper, only does 15%.

**Utility perks**

  - `Auto-loading holster` is a solid choice for your kinetic, especially if it doesn't have a damage boosting perk that requires a reload. With an auto-loading holster kinetic, you basically never need to reload.

### Masterworks

- Range (for PC) and Stability (Console) are mainstays, but Range is less important for a lot of weapons now.
- Handling masterworks are somewhat redundant thanks to Fighting Lion's `Chimera` but it only works one way. If you want quick swap _back_ to your Lion, handling is good.
- Reload masterwork is underrated for Lion users. If your Lion doesn't auto-reload itself, you're potentially looking at reloading both your kinetic and your Lion, so anything that cuts that down is nice. However, because Lion gives your kinetic `Quickdraw`, `Snapshot sights` and `Opening Shot`, you likely have more perk choices can take a Reload perk making a Reload masterwork redundant.

## Specific PvP Recommendations

- `Kill Clip` **Service Revolver** (on console)
- `Vorpal`, `Hipfire Grip` **Breachlight**
- `Kill Clip` **Antiope-D**
- `Rampage`, `Opening Shot` **Duke Mk-44**
- **Redrix's Broadsword**
- `Auto-loading Holster`, `Kill Clip` **Spare Rations**
- **Revoker**
- `Auto-loading holster`, `Opening shot` **Blasphemer**
- `Tap the Trigger` **Smuggler's Word**
